          Howdy readers, I am a full stack engineer learning my way through life.
          I wanted a single place to compile my thoughts and simultaneously
          improve my skills as a web developer. Hence 'Code Courage' was born.

           I would be adding more sections to the site, some required and some not
           so require ones. Feel free to send me feedback if something
           'offends/interests' you.

          This pic was taken in 2014 after a career fair. Since then much has changed.
          But I could not find another pic that I felt more comfortable with.
          As you see looks are not my strong suite :P

          Apart from being an amature cook, average photographer and a casual gamer.
          I like investing time in learning new technologies. Rails, Javascript, Java,
          API and front end design are right at the top of my technical interest list.
